This build procedure uses /usr/include/arpa/tftp.h from glibc (included
by config.h); hence, on Ubuntu 12.04, it requires the libc6-dev package.
Awful, but simple, and it works.

Set the needed environment variables as explained
in 00_NOTES-env_for_cross_compiling.txt (in the root of the repository).

wget https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/network/tftp/tftp-hpa/tftp-hpa-5.2.tar.gz
tar xf tftp-hpa-5.2.tar.gz ; cd tftp-hpa-5.2
Apply tftp-hpa-5.2-android.patch through the "patch -p1 < ..." command.
./configure --host=arm-linux
# It does the same as
# ./configure --host=arm-linux \
#   --with-ipv6 --without-tcpwrappers --without-readline --without-remap
# Do *not* "make -e":
make
$STRIP tftp/tftp tftpd/tftpd
MANWIDTH=70 man tftp/tftp.1 > tftp/tftp.1.txt
MANWIDTH=70 man tftpd/tftpd.8 > tftpd/tftpd.8.txt

NOTE: if you want to use "make -e" instead of "make", then unset
the environment variable AR:
unset AR

Usually, rooted Android systems provide busybox with tftp and tftpd applets
enabled: very likely, on the target system, /system/xbin/tftp
and /system/xbin/tftpd are symbolic links to /system/xbin/busybox.
Hence, to avoid troubles, I suggest to rename, adding the -hpa suffix:
( cd tftp ; mv tftp tftp-hpa ; mv tftp.1.txt tftp-hpa.1.txt )
( cd tftpd ; mv tftpd tftpd-hpa ; mv tftpd.8.txt tftpd-hpa.8.txt )

On the target system, put executables (tftp/tftp-hpa and tftpd/tftpd-hpa)
and docs (tftp/tftp-hpa.1.txt and tftpd/tftpd-hpa.8.txt) where it is
convenient to you.  (Remember to chmod executables.)

An example of usage:
mkdir -p /data/local/tftpboot
./tftpd-hpa -L -u root -a :69 -s -c -U 022 -p /data/local/tftpboot
Stop tftpd-hpa with CTRL-C when you do not need it anymore.
