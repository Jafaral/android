HOWTO build additional kernel modules for Android
*************************************************

----------
Disclaimer
----------

This HOWTO assumes usage of root privileges, i.e. that your device is rooted.
It is also assumed that you are able to use a root shell on a Terminal Emulator
on Android: its usage is implicitly assumed (and is never explicitly cited).
Rooting your Android device might void your warranty, damage it,
kill your cat, burn your house, and cause many other dreadful things.
I do not take any responsibility, you are completely on your own.
If you don't know what "rooting Android" means, this HOWTO is not suited
for you.

-------------------
Scope of this HOWTO
-------------------

So many documents dealing with the Linux kernel compilation for GNU/Linux
are already available.
This document is not intended to write yet another one of them: here, I suppose
that you are already familiar with this topic; if you are not, train yourself
building kernel on GNU/Linux before (it is a good idea anyway :-) ).
There are some documents about cross-compilation of the Linux kernel
for Android, too; I prepared this HOWTO to collect and organize informations
relevant to my needs and to support other HOWTOs I want to write.

--------------
Test platforms
--------------

Tested, not exhaustively, using the following build platforms:
- GNU/Linux Ubuntu 12.04 x86 (32 bit)
- GNU/Linux Ubuntu 14.04 x86_64 (64 bit).

Tested on a Google Nexus 7 3G 2012 tablet, with
- Cyanogenmod 10.1.3
- Cyanogenmod 10.2.1
I made only few tests on 10.2.1, as I experienced some problems
with CTRL and cursor arrows on the Android Terminal Emulator
(both with the virtual keyboard and with an external USB keyboard),
and I was not comfortable with some behaviors of the default shell.
Do not blame me as a newbie: I performed wipings and factory reset more than
once, but such annoying behaviors persisted, and I can not tolerate being
uncomfortable with the only true user interface, i.e. the shell terminal. :-)
Then I went back to 10.1.3 and carried out all the work on it.

NOTE: Cyanogenmod 10.1.3 and 10.2.1 did not load modules I built
with Android NDK; the following error message was returned by insmod:
ftdi_sio: unknown relocation: 27

------------------------
Get Linux kernel sources
------------------------

Download the kernel source tree that has been used to build the kernel
running on your mobile device.
Some relevant repositories may be:
https://android.googlesource.com/
https://github.com/cyanogenmod/
If such sources are either not available or packed without documentation
(and you do not have a crystal ball to guess how to compile them),
search for the kernel source tree that most closely matches your case.

As an example, kernel sources of Cyanogenmod for the Google Nexus 7 2012,
both for the Wi-Fi version (codename: grouper) and the 3G version
(codename: tilapia), can be found [1] at
https://github.com/cyanogenmod/android_kernel_asus_grouper/ =>
https://github.com/cyanogenmod/android_kernel_asus_grouper/tree/cm-10.1
https://github.com/cyanogenmod/android_kernel_asus_grouper/tree/cm-10.2
[...]

Hint: download a zip/tar.gz archive through the web page of the repository,
to save a lot of time and bandwidth; cloning through the git client,
you would download the .git directory, too, that takes a lot of disk space
and bandwidth, and is only needed for more advanced usage of the repository.
The same suggestion may be useful for suubsequent sections of this document.

------------------------------------------------------
Choose a toolchain to cross-compile the kernel sources
------------------------------------------------------

The best option for compatibility: if it is possible (if it is available),
choose the same toolchain that has been used to build the kernel
of your Android distribution.
As you can experience on GNU/Linux, this option is not a must, but minimizes
the risk of binary incompatibilities.

Some available toolchains:

- the prebuilt gcc on android.googlesource.com [2]
  (for 64 bit build platforms only)
  https://android.googlesource.com/platform/prebuilts/gcc/linux-x86/arm/arm-eabi-4.6 =>
  https://android.googlesource.com/platform/prebuilts/gcc/linux-x86/arm/arm-eabi-4.6/+/master =>
  https://android.googlesource.com/platform/prebuilts/gcc/linux-x86/arm/arm-eabi-4.6/+archive/master.tar.gz

- the Cyanogenmod prebuilt toolchain [1] (for 32 bit build platforms;
  installation of some 32 bit libraries is needed on 64 bit build platforms)
  https://github.com/CyanogenMod/android_prebuilt.git =>
  https://github.com/CyanogenMod/android_prebuilt =>
  https://github.com/CyanogenMod/android_prebuilt/tree/cm-10.1 =>
  https://github.com/CyanogenMod/android_prebuilt/archive/cm-10.1.zip
  https://github.com/CyanogenMod/android_prebuilt/tree/cm-10.2 =>
  https://github.com/CyanogenMod/android_prebuilt/archive/cm-10.2.zip
  [...]

- the Android Native Development Kit (NDK) [3]

Install (i.e. unpack) the toolchain(s) in the directory you prefer.

----------------------------------------------------
Set environment variables according to the toolchain
----------------------------------------------------

For all toolchains:
export ARCH=arm
export SUBARCH=arm

For the android.googlesource.com prebuilt gcc:
export PATH=[your_installation_path]/bin:$PATH
(as an example:
 export PATH=/opt/android.googlesource.com/platform/prebuilts/gcc/linux-x86/arm/arm-eabi-4.6/bin:$PATH
)
export CROSS_COMPILE=arm-eabi-

For the Cyanogenmod prebuilt toolchain:
export PATH=[your_installation_path]/linux-x86/toolchain/arm-eabi-4.4.3/bin:$PATH
(as an example:
 export PATH=/opt/android_prebuilt-cm-10.1/linux-x86/toolchain/arm-eabi-4.4.3/bin:$PATH
)
export CROSS_COMPILE=arm-eabi-

For Android NDK:
set the PATH environment variable according to
- usage of either a 32 bit or a 64 bit build platform
- your installation path of the Android NDK
- the cross-compiler version you want to use
as an example:
export PATH=/opt/android-ndk-r9d/toolchains/arm-linux-androideabi-4.6/prebuilt/linux-x86_64/bin:$PATH
export CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-androideabi-

For another toolchain:
search for the documentation of that toolchain :-)
Very likely, the directory to prepend to the PATH environment variable
is the [...]/bin directory where you find many gcc executables named
[NAME_PREFIX]addr2line
[NAME_PREFIX]ar
[NAME_PREFIX]as
[NAME_PREFIX]c++
[NAME_PREFIX]c++filt
[NAME_PREFIX]cpp
[NAME_PREFIX]g++
[NAME_PREFIX]gcc
[NAME_PREFIX]gcov
[NAME_PREFIX]gdb
[NAME_PREFIX]gprof
[NAME_PREFIX]ld
[NAME_PREFIX]nm
[NAME_PREFIX]objcopy
[NAME_PREFIX]objdump
[NAME_PREFIX]ranlib
[NAME_PREFIX]readelf
[NAME_PREFIX]size
[NAME_PREFIX]strings
[NAME_PREFIX]strip
[NAME_PREFIX]...
([NAME_PREFIX] is very likely something as "arm-eabi-",
"arm-linux-androideabi-", and so on)
then, after the PATH environment variable, set
export CROSS_COMPILE=[NAME_PREFIX]
and then hope for the best and try :-)

---------------------------------
Build the needed kernel module(s)
---------------------------------

Unpack the kernel sources and cd to their tree.
Example:
unzip android_kernel_asus_grouper-cm-10.1.zip
cd android_kernel_asus_grouper-cm-10.1

The kernel may refuse loading modules if the vermagic does not match,
thus edit the Makefile to set KERNELRELEASE just according to it [1].
To find the exact target kernel version string, you may either run "uname -a"
on the Android Terminal Emulator, or look for informations about the system
(Kernel version) in the Setting GUI/Application.
Examples about Google Nexus 7 2012 GSM (tilapia):
Settings => About tablet => Kernel version:
CM-10.1.3: 3.1.10-gd08812a build03@cyanogenmod #1 Mod Sep 23 20:47:32 PDT 2013
CM-10.2.1: 3.1.10-g30c5396 build02@cyanogenmod #1 Mon Feb 3 16:09:59 PST 2014
$ uname -a
CM-10.1.3: Linux localhost 3.1.10-gd08812a #1 SMP PREEMPT Mon Sep 23 20:47:32 PDT 2013 armv7l GNU/Linux
CM-10.2.1: Linux localhost 3.1.10-g30c5396 #1 SMP PREEMPT Mon Feb 3 16:09:59 PST 2014 armv7l GNU/Linux
diff Makefile.old Makefile  # for CM-10.1.3:
380c380
< KERNELRELEASE = $(shell cat include/config/kernel.release 2> /dev/null)
---
> KERNELRELEASE = "3.1.10-gd08812a"
Alternatively, you may edit include/config/kernel.release accordingly
(if it exists).
NOTE: in more complex cases, you may have to also edit include/linux/vermagic.h
and some other similar stuff, eventually after some subsequent steps.

Choose a config to start with - if possible, just the one matching the kernel
you are currently running on your mobile device - and copy it as .config
in the kernel sources tree.
Example:
cp arch/arm/configs/cyanogenmod_grouper_defconfig .config

NOTE: check if loadable module support is enabled ("CONFIG_MODULES=y").
If it is not, to add hardware support, rebuilding and reinstalling
(i.e. reflashing) the whole kernel is needed anyway:
- if you want to use modules, you have to build a kernel with loadable module
  support enabled
- if you decide to choose the static option, without loadable module support,
  to change the set of supported hardware you need to rebuild and reinstall
  the whole kernel each time anyway.
As an example, loadable module support is disabled on Cyanogenmod
for the Google Nexus 7 2013 tablet and for the Google Nexus 4 smartphone:
"# CONFIG_MODULES is not set" in
https://github.com/CyanogenMod/android_kernel_google_msm/blob/cm-10.2/arch/arm/configs/cyanogen_flo_defconfig
https://github.com/CyanogenMod/android_kernel_google_msm/blob/cm-10.2/arch/arm/configs/cyanogen_mako_defconfig
https://github.com/CyanogenMod/android_kernel_google_msm/blob/cm-11.0/arch/arm/configs/cyanogen_flo_defconfig
https://github.com/CyanogenMod/android_kernel_google_msm/blob/cm-11.0/arch/arm/configs/cyanogen_mako_defconfig

Manipulate .config as it is usually done on GNU/Linux: after all, you are
dealing with the Linux kernel anyway, even though
- you are *cross*-compiling it
- your target platform is Android/Linux instead of GNU/Linux

Even though you are cross-compiling, you can also use "make menuconfig":
as an example, to build the ftdi_sio.ko and mcs7830.ko modules:

Device Drivers ---> USB support ---> 
                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ check that host-side and OTG support are enabled...
                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ very interesting: USB Gadget Support (http://www.linux-usb.org/gadget)
*** USB port drivers ***
USB Serial Converter support ---> 
<M>   USB FTDI Single Port Serial Driver (CONFIG_USB_SERIAL_FTDI_SIO)

Device Drivers ---> Network device support ---> USB Network Adapters --->
<M>   MosChip MCS7830 based Ethernet adapters

However, a quicker (if appropriate) solution consists of editing .config
with bare hands:
cp .config .config.old
edit .config with a text editor, according to the following diff:
diff .config.old .config
1267c1267
< # CONFIG_USB_NET_MCS7830 is not set
---
> CONFIG_USB_NET_MCS7830=m
2457c2457
< # CONFIG_USB_SERIAL_FTDI_SIO is not set
---
> CONFIG_USB_SERIAL_FTDI_SIO=m

Prepare for build using the provided .config [4], [5]:
make oldconfig
make prepare
make modules_prepare
(For further options, run "make help".)

Build the needed modules; you do not have to build everything, you can avoid
building the static part of the kernel and unneeded (already installed)
modules [5], [6]:
make M=[directory of the module to build]
Examples:
make M=drivers/usb/serial/ # to build drivers/usb/serial/ftdi_sio.ko
make M=drivers/net/usb/    # to build drivers/net/usb/mcs7830.ko
(You may want to run "make" with the -j option to set the number of CPU
cores to be used on the build platform [1], e.g. "make -j2 ..." on a dual-core
netbook; anyway, if you only have to build a few modules, this option
is almost insignificant.)

Strip modules to remove unneded symbols and save memory on the target device
that will run them:
${CROSS_COMPILE}strip --strip-debug [path]/[just_built_module].ko
Example:
ls -l drivers/usb/serial/ftdi_sio.ko  # about 300 kbytes before stripping it
${CROSS_COMPILE}strip --strip-debug drivers/usb/serial/ftdi_sio.ko
ls -l drivers/usb/serial/ftdi_sio.ko  # about 100 kbytes after stripping it
ls -l drivers/net/usb/mcs7830.ko      # about 200 kbytes before stripping it
${CROSS_COMPILE}strip --strip-debug drivers/net/usb/mcs7830.ko
ls -l drivers/net/usb/mcs7830.ko      # about 10 kbytes after stripping it

Through a program capable of viewing/editing binary files (e.g. VIM),
open a .ko module in the target system (very likely, in /system/lib/modules)
and the built module(s), to check if "vermagic=..." is the same;
it is not and the built modules do not load, go back and try again,
changing something accordingly in your build process.

--------------------
Test built module(s)
--------------------

After building a kernel module, you can put it the /data/local directory
(or in /sdcard, or somewhere else) of the target Android device.
The system directory for kernel modules is very likely /system/lib/modules;
I do not suggest using it: apart from the fact that you have to remount
/system as read-write to add/remove files to /system/lib/modules,
custom built modules are more easily identified if you put them elsewhere.
One uploaded a module to the target system, try to load it into
the running kernel: as an example,
insmod /data/local/ftdi_sio.ko
If no errors are reported, check if the module has been loaded:
lsmod | grep ftdi_sio

If something went wrong, try the following commands to investigate:
insmod /data/local/ftdi_sio.ko ; dmesg
insmod /data/local/ftdi_sio.ko ; dmesg | grep ftdi
and then search the web for the problem you are experiencing; an exhaustive
discussion of all possible cases is not possible, you mileage may vary,
I can only wish you good luck :-)
