This build is performed through a native GCC for Android:
https://github.com/marco-pratesi/android/tree/master/gcc_and_friends

Only the telnet client is build, the telnet daemon is not.

Retrieve netkit-telnet_0.17.orig.tar.gz sources from Debian/Ubuntu GNU/Linux
(or from wherever you prefer).
Put the sources archive and netkit-telnet-0.17-android.patch in your
build directory.
Go to your build directory.

tar xf netkit-telnet_0.17.orig.tar.gz ; cd netkit-telnet-0.17
patch -p1 < ../netkit-telnet-0.17-android.patch
cd telnet
make
strip telnet

Put the executable in the directory you prefer, with the filename you prefer.
